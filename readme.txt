1) main.py <-- this file runs the main section of the assignment, implementing all algorithms in order. The output of this file is stored in Output.txt
2) Q3.py <-- This file runs SARSA and QLearning until the policy converges to the optimal policy. Output is stored in Q3.txt
3) Q5.py <-- this file runs SARSA and QLearning on the big lake until it converges to the optimal policy. A converging output is stored in Q5.txt
